# Game Release Calendar

## This Repository

This repository is where Dalton Fussell, Sepan Mustafa, Sam Galbraith, and I are working on a game release calendar as the first project for our coding bootcamp. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate our knowledge of various skills such as using a CSS framework (other than Bootstrap), using multiple server side APIs, responsiveness, client side storage, interactivity, modals, and collaboration.  

## Usage

When the page is loaded, the user is presented with today's date, a calendar, a countdown list, and a search bar. Use the search bar to search for a video game title. The user will be presented with a results page that shows results from IGDB. The result cards will have buttons to add to calendar and/or the countdown list. Clicking these buttons will add them to the sections on the main page. The countdown list will change into the recently searched list. Titles on the recently searched list can be clicked to bring their results up. On the main page, the calendar cards and countdown elements will also have a button to remove the title from the section.
